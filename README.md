Bubble City Design Proposal 2.0

Monica Anderson 

Here is an example of what the user experience might look like. 

Use the Search Feature: Enter [Oblicosm] in the search box and hit return. A new window (or tab, 
depending on your preferences) opens. You have created a "Bubble", and it is displayed in a "Bubble 
Window". In this mode, Bubble City is used a bit like a web search engine like Google or Bing, but it is 
designed to be used for real time messages. The result of a search on Bubble City is a topic specific chat 
room (just one, not a list of results as in web search) where people only discuss the topic you searched for. 
No matter what it is. 
All bubbles open in a new window (or tab). This one will have messages about the Oblicosm, going 
back as far in time as you have screen height for, and can be scrolled. 
You can read these messages to catch up. In low-traffic bubbles there may not be many at all, and some 
messages may be quite old. Messages you have already seen will be displayed in gray. You can scroll 
back in higher-volume bubbles. Or just mark everything as read. 

Sample User Experience : Swipe Tuning 

You start by browsing message titles in the Bubble View. You swipe left on those that are irrelevant to you, or possibly spam, and they turn a reddish gray, but stay around for now. There may be "collateral rejection" of other messages on the same topic also turning reddish gray. You swipe right on the best stuff and such messages (and associated messages on same topic) may get a green highlight. There is a button for refresh, that redraws the screen, discarding everything that was labeled as irrelevant, and accepting the green highlights, which may mean other messages similar to the ones you have right-swiped may appear.  If you are on some device that cannot use swipe then you can use buttons labeled- (Minus) and + (Plus) on each message to deprecate or encourage that message, and any similar messages.  You can now click on any message that looks extra interesting. Another window/tab opens and in there, this message will be in the center. Above it, in reverse chronological order, you see older messages being added in reverse time sequence going upward (towards older messages) and if there is traffic in the bubble, you will see the new messages in the thread for the bubble of the clicked message appear below the initial message.  If you do not swipe-tune, then this bubble will stay true to the spirit of the original message you clicked on, but you can swipe-tune any message in any display at any time, and your swipe-tunes will become permanently part of your Bubble definition when you close and save the Bubble.  Also, when you have opened a Thread view on some single message and its thread, you can immediately 
reply to the message you clicked on. This is the most common way to post something. Click on something 
interesting, see its thread, type a reply, and then stay around watching the thread continue after your own 
message. 
To get a topic started, create (enter) a Bubble. If there is no traffic in the Bubble, just post something and 
others may reply. They may have entered the same Bubble weeks ago.


## ClickBait Headlines Completely Eliminated 

We can totally avoid clickbait headlines. I reserve disclosure of this mechanism to NDA level discussions. 
This solution also simplifies or solves several other problems in Service design and implementation. 
Traf f ic Logging for Machine Learning 
All posts are public. All posts need to be kept for at least some time in a repository so that they can be 
displayed to others as required, but this is designed to be a real-time system so we may impose limits on 
history length. 
Because everything is public, users have no expectation of privacy for this content. We will use messages 
in our message repository as a corpus for training future versions of the system. We will not sell these 
corpora to outsiders but may share them with (corporate) collaborators for language research and product 
enhancement purposes.

No Voting On Messages 
SlashDot and Reddit use voting. This should be unnecessary and is mostly a nerd-favored solution to 
noise problems. No Need for #HashTags 
#HashTags were invented by both IRC and Twitter users in response to the service lacking a decent 
semantic search capability. 
We cannot prevent users from using these features but we can decide whether we want to explicitly 
support tagging by (for instance) providing a tag canonicalizing service. 
IRC and Twitter users use this Edit Button 
This seems important to some people, but editing would change the Bubble definition and this causes 
trouble in many places. This is definitively not going to be in the first release. 
No Subscription fees 
This substantially lowers the threshold for joining. 
No Advertising 
This would substantially lower the enjoyment of the system.We want to monetize this service exclusively 
by selling postage. Links
